madlib = f"I got into computer programming because it is so {adj}. It makes me want to {verb1}. When I start typing, \
I forget about time. My {noun} has to remind me to {verb2} otherwise I will look like a {noun2}. \
{famous_person} once said 'Be sure to get some sleep, or else you will look like a {noun3}.'\
I laughed at that one. How could I look like {noun3}, when I am a girl with short hair. My {noun} gave \
me a {noun4} when I am spending to much time coding. I love {noun5}!"
